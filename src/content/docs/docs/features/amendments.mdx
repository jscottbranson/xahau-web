title: Amendments
---
Amendments represent new features or other changes to transaction processing.

The amendment system uses the consensus process to approve any changes that affect transaction processing on Xahau. Fully-functional, transaction process changes are introduced as amendments; validators then vote on these changes. If an amendment receives more than 80% support for five days, the amendment passes and the change applies permanently to all subsequent ledger versions. Disabling a passed amendment requires a new amendment to do so.

**Note:** Bug fixes that change transaction processes also require amendments.

### Amendment Process

The Contributing Code to Xahau topic walks through the workflow to develop an amendment from an idea to activation on Xahau.

After the code for an amendment is built into a software release, the process to enable it happens within the Xahau network, which checks the status of amendments every _flag_ ledger (typically about 15 minutes apart).

Every 256th ledger is called a **flag** ledger. The flag ledger doesn't have special contents, but the amendment process happens around it.

1. **Flag Ledger -1:** When `xahaud` validators send validation messages, they also submit their amendment votes.
2. **Flag Ledger:** Servers interpret the votes from trusted validators.
3.  **Flag Ledger +1:** Servers insert an `EnableAmendment` pseudo-transaction and flag based on what they think happened:

    * The `tfGotMajority` flag means the amendment has more than 80% support.
    * The `tfLostMajority` flag means support for the amendment has decreased to 80% or less.
    * No flag means the amendment is enabled.

    **Note:** It's possible for an amendment to lose 80% support on the same ledger it reaches the required five day period to be enabled. In these cases, an `EnableAmendment` pseudo-transactions is added for both scenarios, but the amendment is ultimately enabled.
4. **Flag Ledger +2:** Enabled amendments apply to transactions on this ledger onwards.

### Amendment Voting

Each version of `xahaud` is compiled with a list of known amendments and the code to implement those amendments. Operators of `xahaud` validators configure their servers to vote on each amendment and can change it at any time. If the operator doesn't choose a vote, the server uses a default vote defined by the source code.

**Note:** The default vote can change between software releases. \[Updated in: rippled 1.8.1]\[]

Amendments must maintain five days of support from more than 80% of trusted validators to be enabled. If support drops below 80%, the amendment is temporarily rejected, and the two week period restarts. Amendments can gain and lose a majority any number of times before they become permanently enabled.

Amendments that have had their source code removed without being enabled are considered **Vetoed** by the network.

### Amendment Blocked Servers

Amendment blocking is a security feature to protect the accuracy of Xahau's data. When an amendment is enabled, servers running earlier versions of `xahaud` without the amendment's source code no longer understand the rules of the network. Rather than guess and misinterpret ledger data, these servers become **amendment blocked** and can't:

* Determine the validity of a ledger.
* Submit or process transactions.
* Participate in the consensus process.
* Vote on future amendments.

The voting configuration of a `xahaud` server has no impact on it becoming amendment blocked. A `xahaud` server always follows the amendments enabled by the rest of the network, so blockages are based solely on having the code to understand rule changes. This means you can also become amendment blocked if you connect your server to a parallel network with different amendments enabled. For example, the Xahau Testnet typically has experimental amendments enabled. If you are using the latest production release, your server likely won't have the code for those experimental amendments.

You can unblock amendment blocked servers by upgrading to the newest version of `xahaud`.

### Retiring Amendments

When amendments are enabled, the source code for pre-amendment behaviors remain in `xahaud`. While there are use-cases for keeping old code, such as reconstructing ledger outcomes for verification, tracking amendments and legacy code adds complexity over time.

The [XRP Ledger Standard 11d](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/19) defines a process for retiring old amendments and associated pre-amendment code. After an amendment has been enabled on the Mainnet for two years, it can be retired. Retiring an amendment makes it part of the core protocol unconditionally; it's no longer tracked or treated as an amendment, and all pre-amendment code is removed.

### Known Amendments

The following amendments have been implemented or are in the process of being enabled on Xahau:

#### Feature Amendments

##### XahauGenesis

Enables the genesis account to mint XAH and distribute it via [GenesisMint transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/genesismint-emitted-txn).

##### MultiSign

Enables multi-signature functionality, allowing accounts to require multiple signatures for transactions. This amendment introduces [SignerListSet transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/signerlistset) and [SignerList ledger objects](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-objects-types/signers-list) to support multi-signing.

##### DepositAuth

Enables deposit authorization functionality, allowing accounts to require preauthorization before receiving payments. This amendment introduces [DepositPreauth transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/depositpreauth) and [DepositPreauth ledger objects](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-objects-types/deposit-pre-auth) to manage preauthorizations.

##### Hooks

Core amendment enabling Hook smart contract functionality on Xahau. _(Added by the [Hooks amendment][].)_

##### HooksUpdate1

Updates and improvements to the Hooks system.

##### Remit

Enables [Remit transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/remit) that allow sending multiple payment types, minting URITokens, transferring URITokens, and activating accounts in a single transaction.

##### ZeroB2M

Enables Burn2Mint operations with zero amounts. Fixes issues related to Burn2Mint operations when dealing with zero amounts.

##### Remarks

Enables [SetRemarks transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/setremarks) that allow accounts to attach, update, or remove arbitrary remarks (key-value pairs) on supported ledger objects.

##### Touch

Enables Touch transactions for account activation and interaction.

##### HookCanEmit

Adds the `HookCanEmit` field to [HookDefinition](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-objects-types/hook-definition) objects, specifying which transaction types a hook is allowed to emit.

##### Clawback

Enables [Clawback transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/clawback) that allow issuers to revoke tokens that were previously issued by their account.

##### DeepFreeze

Enables deep freeze functionality for trustlines and assets.

##### IOUIssuerWeakTSH

Makes IOU issuers weak transactional stakeholders (TSH) in certain transaction types. See [Weak and Strong](/docs/hooks/concepts/weak-and-strong) for details.

##### Cron

Enables scheduled Hook execution via [CronSet transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/cronset) and [Cron ledger objects](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-objects-types/cron). _(Added by the [CronSet amendment][].)_

##### ExtendedHookState

Extends Hook state management capabilities, including the `HookStaleScale` field for [AccountRoot](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-objects-types/accountroot) objects to control when Hook state entries become stale. _(Added by the [ExtendedHookState amendment][].)_
