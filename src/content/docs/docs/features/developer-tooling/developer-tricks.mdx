## Wildcard signing

To easily test & replay, use `NetworkID` with value `65535` (config: `[network_id]`) to disable signature verification.

## Server Definitions

Server definitions can easily be fetched from public nodes. These definitions include binary codec information and other network-specific data needed for transaction serialization and deserialization.

### Mainnet
- [`https://xahau.network/server_definitions.json`](https://xahau.network/server_definitions.json)

### Testnet
- [`https://xahau-test.net/server_definitions.json`](https://xahau-test.net/server_definitions.json)

### JSHooks-Testnet
- [`https://jshooks.xahau-test.net/server_definitions.json`](https://jshooks.xahau-test.net/server_definitions.json)

These server definitions are essential for:
- Binary codec operations
- Transaction serialization
- Field type definitions
- Network-specific constants

You can use these definitions in your applications to properly encode and decode transactions for the Xahau network.
