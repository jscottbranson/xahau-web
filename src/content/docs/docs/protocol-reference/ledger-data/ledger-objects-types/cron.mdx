_(Added by the [Cron amendment][].)_

A `Cron` object represents a scheduled Hook execution created by a [CronSet transaction](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/cronset). The Cron engine automatically inserts pseudo-transactions of type `Cron` into the ledger when scheduled executions are due.

### Fields

A `Cron` object has the following fields:

| Field               | JSON Type | \[Internal Type]\[] | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Owner`             | String    | AccountID           | Yes       | The account that owns the scheduled Hook execution. This is the account that will be invoked when the cron executes.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `OwnerNode`         | String    | UInt64              | Yes       | A hint indicating which page of the owner's directory links to this object, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. **Note:** The object does not contain a direct link to the owner directory containing it, since that value can be derived from the `Owner`. |
| `StartTime`         | Number    | UInt32              | Yes       | Ripple Epoch timestamp when the first execution should occur. Use `0` for immediate execution. See \[Specifying Time]\[] for details.                                                                                                                                          |
| `RepeatCount`       | Number    | UInt32              | Yes       | Number of times the cron should execute. Can be extended via subsequent [CronSet transactions](/docs/protocol-reference/transactions/transaction-types/cronset). Maximum 256 per transaction, but can be extended beyond this limit.                                                          |
| `DelaySeconds`      | Number    | UInt32              | Yes       | Time interval in seconds between each execution. Maximum of 31,536,000 seconds (365 days).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | String    | Hash256             | Yes       | The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this object.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` | Number    | UInt32              | Yes       | The \[index of the ledger]\[Ledger Index] that contains the transaction that most recently modified this object.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `LedgerEntryType`   | String    | UInt16              | Yes       | The value `0x0072`, mapped to the string `Cron`, indicates that this object is a Cron object.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Cron ID Format

The ID of a `Cron` object is the \[SHA-512Half]\[] of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The Cron space key (`0x0076`)
* The timestamp of the `StartTime` field
* The randomized AccountID of the `Owner` field

### Execution Behavior

When a cron is ready to execute, the Cron engine inserts a pseudo-transaction of type `Cron` into the ledger. This pseudo-transaction contains an `Owner` field referencing the originating Hook account. The scheduled Hook will be invoked automatically at the specified intervals without requiring external triggers.

Hook developers must enable collect calls (`hsfCOLLECT` flag) on their Hooks, as the `Owner` constitutes a weak transactional stakeholder (TSH) when the Cron pseudo-transaction executes.
