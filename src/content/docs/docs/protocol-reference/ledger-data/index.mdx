title: Ledger Data
---
Each ledger version in the XRP Ledger is made up of three parts:

* **Ledger Header**: Metadata about this ledger version itself.
* **Transaction Set**: All the transactions that were executed to create this ledger version.
* **State Data**: The complete record of objects representing accounts, settings, and balances as of this ledger version. (This is also called the "account state".)

### State Data

Each ledger version's state data is a set of **ledger objects**, sometimes called _ledger entries_, which collectively represent all settings, balances, and relationships at a given point in time. To store or retrieve an object in the state data, the protocol uses that object's unique [**Ledger Object ID**](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-object-ids).

In the peer protocol, ledger objects have a [canonical binary format](/docs/protocol-reference/binary-format). In `xahaud` APIs, ledger objects are represented as JSON objects.

A ledger object's data fields depend on the type of object; the Xahau Network supports the following types:

* [Ledger Header](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-header)
* [Ledger Entry Common Fields](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-object-ids)
* [Ledger Entry Types](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-objects-types/)

### Expanded Ledgers

Xahau supports expanded ledgers, which allow for larger ledger sizes beyond the traditional limits. Expanded ledgers enable the network to handle increased transaction volumes and more complex state data while maintaining performance and consensus stability.

When expanded ledgers are enabled, the ledger can accommodate:
- More transactions per ledger
- Larger state data sets
- Increased complexity in Hook executions

Expanded ledgers are automatically used when the network determines they are necessary based on transaction volume and state size. No special configuration is required for nodes to participate in expanded ledgers.
