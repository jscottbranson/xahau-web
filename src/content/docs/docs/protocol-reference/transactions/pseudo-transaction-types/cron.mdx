_(Added by the [CronSet amendment][].)_

The `Cron` pseudo-transaction is automatically inserted into the ledger by the Cron engine when a scheduled Hook execution is due. This pseudo-transaction triggers the execution of the Hook on the account specified in the `Owner` field.

### Example

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "Cron",
  "Account": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "Fee": "0",
  "Sequence": 0,
  "SigningPubKey": "",
  "TxnSignature": "",
  "Owner": "rWYkbWkCeg8dP6rXALnjgZSjjLyih5NXm"
}
```

### Fields

| Field | JSON Type | \[Internal Type]\[] | Description |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| `Owner` | String | AccountID | The account that owns the scheduled Hook execution. This is the account that will be invoked when the cron executes. |

### Common Fields

As a pseudo-transaction, `Cron` uses the standard pseudo-transaction values for common fields:

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| `Account` | `rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhoLvTp` (`ACCOUNT_ZERO`) |
| `Fee` | `0` |
| `Sequence` | `0` |
| `SigningPubKey` | `""` (empty string) |
| `TxnSignature` | `""` (empty string) |

### Execution Behavior

When a [Cron ledger object](/docs/protocol-reference/ledger-data/ledger-objects-types/cron) is ready to execute (based on its `StartTime`, `DelaySeconds`, and `RepeatCount` fields), the Cron engine automatically inserts a `Cron` pseudo-transaction into the ledger.

The pseudo-transaction contains an `Owner` field that references the account with the scheduled Hook. The Hook on that account will be invoked automatically, and the account is treated as a **weak transactional stakeholder (TSH)** during execution.

**Important:** Hook developers must enable collect calls (`hsfCOLLECT` flag) on their Hooks, as the `Owner` constitutes a weak transactional stakeholder when the Cron pseudo-transaction executes. The account must also have the `asfTshCollect` flag enabled.
