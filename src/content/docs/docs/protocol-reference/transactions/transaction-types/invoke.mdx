_(Added by the [Hooks amendment][].)_

### Example

```json
{
    "TransactionType": "Invoke",
    "Account": "rWYkbWkCeg8dP6rXALnjgZSjjLyih5NXm",
    "Blob": "697066733A2F2F4445414442454546",
    "Destination": "rPT1Sjq2YGrBMTttX4GZHjKu9dyfzbpAYe"
}
```

| Field            | JSON Type | \[Internal Type]\[] | Required? | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Account`        | String    | AccountID           | Yes       | The address of the account that is invoking the hook.                                              |
| `Blob`           | String    | Blob                | No        | A blob of data that is passed to the hook. (512 byte max)                                        |
| `Destination`   | String    | AccountID           | No        | The address of the account that is the target of the hook.                                         |

### Special Transaction Cost

The Invoke transaction has a standard transaction cost, plus an additional cost based on the size of the Blob field.

### Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, Invoke transactions can result in the following transaction result codes:

| Error Code      | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `temDISABLED`   | Occurs if the Hooks amendment is not enabled.                            |
| `temMALFORMED`  | Occurs if the Blob field is larger than 512 bytes.                        |
| `terNO_ACCOUNT` | Occurs if the sending account or the destination account does not exist. |
